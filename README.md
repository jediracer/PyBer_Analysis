# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
Analyze ride-sharing data based on city type (urban, suburban & rural).

## Resources
- Data Sources: 
	- city_data.csv
	- ride_data.csv
- Software: Python 3.8.8, Visual Studio Code 1.57.1

## Results
- The total number of drivers seem to be correlated with the expect population density of the 3 city types (urban, suburban & rural).
	- Urban had the most drivers (2405).
	- Suburban had significantly fewer drivers than urban (490).
	- Rural, as expected due to the population being more spread out over a larger area, had the fewest drivers (78).
- The average fares, per ride and per driver, seemed proportionate based on the distance each ride would expectantly be.
	- The fares in Rural areas were the highest with an average per ride fare of $34.62 and an average per driver fare of $55.49.
	- Suburban areas were again in the middle with an average per ride fare of $30.97 and an average per driver fare of $38.50.
	- Urban, as expected due to the destinations being closer than the other 2 city types, had the smallest average per ride fare of $24.53 and an average per driver fare of $16.57.

- The Pyber Fare Summary clearly shows the correlation between the number of drivers and the Total Fares collected.

## Summary
- Recommendations
	1. More drivers across all three city types would increase the total fares, however the rural areas would see the greatest increase due to the high average fares. 
	2. Increased fare prices would have the greatest impact in the urban areas, as the urban area ride count is more than twice the total of rural and suburban areas combined.
	3. Suburban areas could benefit from a fare price increase and increase number of drivers, with an emphasis on the increase in the number of drivers.
