# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
Analyze ride-sharing data based on city type (urban, suburban & rural).

## Resources
- Data Sources: 
	- city_data.csv
	- ride_data.csv
- Software: Python 3.8.8, Visual Studio Code 1.57.1

## Results
	- The total number of drivers seem to be correlated with the expect population density of the 3 city types.
		- Urban had the most drivers (2405).
		- Suburban had significantly fewer drivers than urban (490).
		- Rural, as expected due to the population being more spread out over a larger area, had the fewest drivers (78).
	- The average fares, per ride and per driver, seemed proportionate based on the distance each ride would expectantly would be.
		- The fares in Rural areas were the highest with an average per ride fare of $34.62 and an average per driver fare of $55.49.
		- Suburban areas were again in the middle with an average per ride fare of $30.97 and an average per driver fare of $38.50.
		- Urban, as expected due to the destinations being close than the other 2 city types, had the smallest average per ride fare of $24.53 and an average per driver fare of $16.57.
